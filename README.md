## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This was fun.

Took me a bit of time to figure out how to make the mix background of an image and color.
Also had a fun time overwriting bootstrap accordion styles for the arrows and highlighting of accordion headers
First time i had to make use of @media in order to state what the .card appearance has to be in a screen <576px
